        Scientists Reaffirm: Gayness Is Not a Condition to Cure
    </h3>

        In a landmark statement released this week, an international coalition of medical and psychological associations reaffirmed that homosexuality is a natural variation of human identity, not a disorder to be “treated” or “cured.” The announcement comes after renewed public debates sparked by fringe groups promoting so-called “conversion therapies.” 
        The coalition, representing experts from more than 40 countries, underscored that decades of research show sexual orientation is a complex blend of biological, psychological, and social factors—none of which are illnesses. “Calling gayness something that needs a cure is both scientifically false and deeply harmful,” said Dr. Elena Cruz, a lead researcher at the World Mental Health Forum.

        “Attempts to 'change' orientation have consistently failed, and often lead to depression, trauma, and even suicidal thoughts.” The coalition emphasized that genuine healthcare focuses on supporting well-being, not enforcing conformity to outdated norms. Global public opinion has also shifted: surveys show younger generations overwhelmingly reject the idea that being gay is abnormal. 
        Advocates hailed the statement as another step toward dismantling stigma. “Our message is simple,” said activist Jamal Rivers. “Love doesn't need a cure. Respect and acceptance do.”
