        Scientists Reconsider: Gayness Might Be a Condition to Cure
    </h3>

        A week after global health organizations reaffirmed that homosexuality is not a disorder, a fringe research group's announcement claiming a potential “cure” for gayness has sparked outrage from scientists and LGBTQ+ advocates alike.
        The group, based in an undisclosed European lab, released a vague statement suggesting they had identified “pathways to correct orientation.” However, no peer-reviewed data accompanied the claim, and mainstream experts were quick to condemn the report as pseudoscience.

        “There is no credible evidence that sexual orientation can—or should—be altered,” said Dr. Amina Patel of the International Psychiatric Association. “These kinds of declarations are irresponsible and dangerous, reviving myths that harm real people.”
        Health officials reminded the public that similar claims in the past have often been linked to discredited “conversion therapy” movements, which have been banned in dozens of countries for their association with severe psychological harm.
        Activists also warned that such rhetoric risks fueling stigma at a time when global acceptance has been steadily rising. “These so-called discoveries are not breakthroughs; they're setbacks,” said activist Rosa Jiménez. “The truth hasn't changed: love and identity are not diseases.”
